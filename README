This implements the random effects likelihood for ANC HIV prevalence described by
Alkema, Raftery, Clark Ann Appl Stat 2007 (http://dx.doi.org/10.1214/07-AOAS111).
This is implemented in the EPP model used by UNAIDS for generating HIV epidemic
trends: http://www.unaids.org/en/dataanalysis/datatools/spectrumepp2013.

It relies on GNU Scientific Library (GSL) for adapative Gaussian quadrature
numerical intergration routine (http://www.gnu.org/software/gsl/).

It uses mvrandist code for multivariate normal pdf. At present these are copied
into the repo, but should revise to include as a submodule when I figure out
how to do that.

At present there's not a good standalone testing / example script. I'll try to
add this in the future, along with R implementation of the likelihood.
